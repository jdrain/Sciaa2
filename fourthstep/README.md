1. Improvements Needed
  + Cleaning of the final text can be improved a little bit
  + Spellcheck just needs to be better in general. Although it may be
    close to the point of diminishing returns...
2. Main 
  + Main.py will run a batch process to get data from individual text
    files and write to a singular CSV.
3. Customization
  + Should one want to write their own main:
  + spellcheck.py holds methods to run a spellchecker on a file
  + parser.py parses a file to grab pertinent info
  + checkAndParse.py implements these to process a textfile from I to O.
implementing these methods
  + other files are scripts to test these methods
4. Other
  + a few .json files are included; these hold information that the
    parser needs to decide which lines to pull and which to ignore.
  + output can be formatted as .txt or .csv, depending on
    preference
